# Docker Environment Test Results

## Test Date: 2025-07-16

## Issue Found: Docker Not Installed

### Problem
Docker is not installed or not accessible on the system. This prevents running the local development environment.

### Error Messages
- `docker-compose: command not found`
- `docker: command not found`

### Checks Performed
1. Checked for `docker` and `docker-compose` commands - Not found
2. Checked `/usr/local/bin/docker` - Not present
3. Checked running processes for Docker - None found
4. Checked `/Applications` directory for Docker Desktop - Not visible

## Resolution Steps

### Option 1: Install Docker Desktop for Mac
1. Download Docker Desktop from https://www.docker.com/products/docker-desktop
2. Install the application
3. Start Docker Desktop
4. Verify installation with `docker --version`

### Option 2: Install Docker via Homebrew
```bash
# Install Homebrew if not already installed
/bin/bash -c "$(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Homebrew/install/HEAD/install.sh)"

# Install Docker and Docker Compose
brew install --cask docker

# Start Docker Desktop
open /Applications/Docker.app
```

### Option 3: Use Colima (lightweight alternative)
```bash
# Install Colima and Docker CLI
brew install colima docker docker-compose

# Start Colima
colima start

# Verify Docker is working
docker ps
```

## Project Configuration Review

### Services Configured in docker-compose.yml
The following services are properly configured and ready to run once Docker is installed:

1. **PostgreSQL** (postgres:15-alpine)
   - Port: 5432
   - Database: personalpod_dev
   - User: personalpod
   - Health check: Configured

2. **Redis** (redis:7-alpine)
   - Port: 6379
   - Persistence: Enabled (AOF)
   - Health check: Configured

3. **Elasticsearch** (8.11.1)
   - Port: 9200 (HTTP), 9300 (Transport)
   - Mode: Single-node
   - Security: Disabled for development
   - Health check: Configured

4. **LocalStack** (latest)
   - Port: 4566 (main), 4571 (legacy)
   - Services: S3, DynamoDB, Lambda, API Gateway, CloudFormation, IAM, STS, Secrets Manager, SES, SQS, SNS
   - Health check: Configured
   - Setup script: Available at `/scripts/localstack/setup.sh`

5. **Nginx** (alpine)
   - Ports: 80 (HTTP), 443 (HTTPS)
   - Configuration: Custom nginx.conf
   - SSL: Certificates directory configured
   - Health check: Configured

6. **API** (Node.js custom build)
   - Port: 3000
   - Build: Multi-stage Dockerfile configured
   - Environment: Properly configured for all service connections
   - Health check: Configured

### Available Scripts and Tools

1. **Makefile Commands**
   - `make dev` - Start development environment
   - `make dev-logs` - View logs
   - `make dev-down` - Stop containers
   - `make dev-clean` - Stop and remove volumes
   - `make check-services` - Check service health
   - `make reset-db` - Reset database
   - `make backup-db` - Backup database

2. **Dev Utils Script** (`scripts/dev-utils.sh`)
   - Health checks for all services
   - Database backup/restore functionality
   - Log viewing utilities
   - Docker cleanup commands

3. **LocalStack Setup** (`scripts/localstack/setup.sh`)
   - Creates S3 buckets: personalpod-dev-uploads, personalpod-dev-backups
   - Creates DynamoDB table: personalpod-sessions
   - Creates SQS queues: email-queue, job-queue.fifo
   - Creates SNS topic: personalpod-notifications
   - Creates Secrets Manager secrets for database and JWT

## Next Steps

1. Install Docker using one of the methods above
2. Run `docker --version` to verify installation
3. Run `make dev` to start all services
4. Run `make check-services` to verify all services are healthy
5. Access services at:
   - API: https://localhost:3000
   - PostgreSQL: localhost:5432
   - Redis: localhost:6379
   - Elasticsearch: http://localhost:9200
   - LocalStack: http://localhost:4566

## Testing Scripts Created

### 1. Docker Check Script (`scripts/check-docker.sh`)
Run this first to verify Docker installation:
```bash
./scripts/check-docker.sh
```

### 2. Environment Test Script (`scripts/test-environment.sh`)
Comprehensive test suite that:
- Verifies Docker installation
- Generates SSL certificates if needed
- Starts all containers
- Tests each service connectivity
- Performs basic operations (Redis write/read, S3 access)
- Checks for errors in logs
- Provides detailed test results

Run with:
```bash
./scripts/test-environment.sh
```

## Alternative Testing Without Docker

If Docker cannot be installed, consider:
1. Using a cloud development environment (GitHub Codespaces, Gitpod)
2. Installing services individually on the local machine
3. Using a remote development server with Docker pre-installed

## Common Issues and Solutions

### Port Conflicts
If services fail to start due to port conflicts:
```bash
# Check which processes are using the ports
lsof -i :5432,6379,9200,4566,3000,80,443

# Stop conflicting services or change ports in docker-compose.override.yml
```

### Docker Memory Issues
If Elasticsearch or other services crash:
1. Increase Docker Desktop memory allocation (Preferences > Resources)
2. Recommended: At least 4GB RAM for all services

### SSL Certificate Issues
If HTTPS connections fail:
```bash
# Regenerate certificates
rm -rf nginx/ssl
./scripts/ssl/generate-certs.sh
```

### LocalStack Issues
If AWS services fail:
```bash
# Check LocalStack logs
docker-compose logs localstack

# Manually run setup
docker-compose exec localstack awslocal s3 ls
```
